task: |
  **Constraints:**
  - Use only one sub-structure.
  - The vehicle must have at least four wheels.
  - The vehicle must be capable of forward driving and demonstrate a steering mechanism.
  - Conventional steering mechanisms (e.g., rotating front wheels relative to the body) are not available with the provided blocks. Alternative steering strategies must be employed.

  **Goal:**
  - Drive the vehicle from the starting position (x=0, y=0) on the ground to the target position (x=10, y=10) on the ground (north-east direction) in the simulation environment.

  **Evaluation Protocol:**
  - The vehicle will be placed at (x=0, y=0) on the ground in the simulation environment.
  - An open-loop control sequence will be programmed by a specialized AI agent following your plan, consisting of a list of commands with the format:
    - [time: when to press the control key, command: the control key to press, duration: how long to hold the key]
  - The trajectory of the vehicle will be recorded as feedback and optimized over three trials by adjusting the control sequence.
  - The final score will be the best score across the three trials.

  **Scoring Metrics:**
  - *Trajectory Deviation:* Distance between the actual trajectory and the ideal straight-line path from start to target (smaller is better).
  - *Structure Stability:* Whether the vehicle remains intact during driving (higher stability is better).
  - *Time Efficiency:* Time taken to reach the target position (shorter is better).
  - *Cost:* Number of blocks used to construct the vehicle (fewer is better).

  **Constraints:**
  - Use only one sub-structure.

  **Goal:**
  - Build a bridge capable of spanning a gap between two flat terrains (5 units wide, 5 units high).
  - The bridge must be able to support a 2.5 × 2.5 × 1.5 cargo placed at its center.

  **Evaluation Protocol:**
  - The terrains are positioned with edges at (x=0, y=2.5, z=5) and (x=0, y=-2.5, z=5), forming a 5-unit-wide gap along the north–south axis with a vertical drop of 5 units.
  - The bridge will be initially placed at (x=0, y=0, z=7), slightly above the terrain tops, so it can gently fall into position.
  - There will be no fixed connection between the bridge and the terrain.
  - A cargo of size 2.5 × 2.5 × 1.5 will be dropped at (x=0, y=0, z=7), directly above the center of the gap.
  - The cargo will rest on the bridge without any fixed connection.
  - The cargo’s weight will gradually and linearly increase from zero (no initial impact).
  - The trajectory of the cargo will be tracked; the load at which the cargo sinks below the gap will be recorded as the bridge’s maximum supported load.
  - If the bridge fails to span the gap or misses the cargo at the start, the score is 0.

  **Scoring Metrics:**
  - *Maximum Load:* Maximum load supported before the cargo falls below the gap (higher is better).
  - *Cost:* Number of blocks used to build the bridge (fewer is better).
